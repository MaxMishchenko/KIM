                <p>In June 2015, at age 33, I had a heart attack ( NSTEMI) and received a stent. Despite exercising and eating “clean,” I missed the bigger picture. Three weeks into recovery, an integrative physician colleague suspected deeper issues. Testing revealed:</p>

In that season, I believe God met me and helped me connect key patterns: mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome imbalance, environmental toxicity, and nervous system dysregulation. My body wasn’t failing—it was crying for help. Improvement came from restoring balance, not adding more pills. It was neither quick nor easy—but it worked.</p>
