                    <p class="testimonials__text font--primary font--16 font--normal color--text-black lh--150 mb--16">Following a serious mold exposure, I reached out to work with Dr. Kim. I couldn't understand why all the binders I was taking were making me feel sick and depleted, not better! <br> Dr. Kim had me switch to supplements, foods, and lifestyle changes that supported my mitochondria, nervous system and the integrity of my cell membranes. This made all the difference in calming my rattled body and mind. With some investigation, we found that my home required additional mold remediation to make it a cleaner environment for healing. Dr. Kim provided me with comprehensive protocols to assist my body in removing what it didn't need, as well as providing the nutrition it needed to heal.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials__text-secondary font--primary font--16 font--normal color--text-black lh--150 hidden">Dr. Kim's compassion, thoroughness and expertise in root cause medicine make him a gift to the wellness community. His humor and hope following his own struggle with chronic illness is inspiring, reminding us that with POSITIVITY and PERSISTENCE, better days lie ahead! I will be forever grateful to Dr. Kim for guiding me through a dark time into the SUNSHINE. (Literally sun gazing in the morning at sunrise, 15-20 minutes, even if it's freezing outside!)</p>

                    <p class="testimonials__text font--primary font--16 font--normal color--text-black lh--150 mb--16">I cannot recommend Dr. Kim highly enough! His functional approach to medicine completely transformed my understanding of health and healing. After struggling with digestion issues for years, I had nearly lost faith in traditional medicine. But Dr. Kim showed me that healing doesn't always require pharmaceuticals—sometimes, the right combination of natural supplements, proper nutrition, exercise, and meditation is all that’s needed. <br> His comprehensive approach made me rethink even my use of a contraceptive pill. He took the time to educate me on potential side effects—ranging from stroke to nausea and even gut microbiome disruption—that I had never fully considered. Thanks to his guidance, I discovered natural contraceptive alternatives, including innovative contraceptive apps that I hadn't even known existed. <br> Dr. Kim is incredibly knowledgeable, compassionate, and thorough. He doesn’t just treat symptoms—he empowers his patients with knowledge and sustainable solutions. If you’re looking for a pharmacist who understands true, long-lasting wellness and puts your health first, look no further. Highly recommend!</p>

                    <p class="testimonials__text font--primary font--16 font--normal color--text-black lh--150 mb--16">I am so thankful to God for Dr. Kim's help. I was struggling every day with POTS, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and gut issues. I did not feel myself or able to keep up with life. It was especially discouraging trying to care for my 3-year-old son. Dr. Kim's assessments, testing, and protocols are thorough, unlike other providers I've seen. He was very generous with his time for all my questions and concerns. We found my root issues, including mold toxicity, adrenal fatigue, nervous system dysregulation, SIBO, and parasites. I loved how he looked at my health on all levels, including lifestyle and circadian rhythm. With his guidance, I found and remediated a mold issue in my HVAC system. I could tell such a difference in how I felt afterward! After 6 months, I am so happy to say my thyroid levels are within normal range, I am mold toxin-free, and my gut functions normally! I also lost some stubborn weight, learned how to better regulate my nervous system, and regained my energy and confidence. Do not hesitate to get high-quality care from Dr. Kim, you will not regret the investment!</p>

After working with him, I found out that I had a deeper issue dealing with detoxing because of mold and heavy metals. I’m still working through my challenges, but I am less reactive than before. I’m now able to enjoy my life and not worry so much about what I may end up reacting to.</p>

I’ve worked with some of the best functional practitioners, yet remained so very stuck. I decided to work with Dr. Kim to overcome my health issues, and it has truly been a turning point in my life. Yes, there is the tailored protocol which is vital, but he has taught me something even more important than that. He taught me to reconnect with myself, and my faith. I have been shut down for many years, and I didn’t realize how affected I was by my current situation, but also past traumas which absolutely had a deleterious effect on my health. Dr. Kim looks at the whole person, and helps you to see where the breakdowns are. Physically and environmentally, which is critical, but also emotionally and spiritually. It’s a complete approach that is shifting my health for the first time in decades. I’ve always felt that I could get better, but something was missing. Dr. Kim filled in the previously unseen pieces. I could not be more thankful for his guidance, and kindness, throughout this process.</p>
